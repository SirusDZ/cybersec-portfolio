# 📝 Notes

This folder is my learning notebook.  
I’ll keep summaries of key topics, commands, and tips here.  

## Topics may include
- Linux basics and commands  
- Networking & protocols  
- Security tools (Nmap, Wireshark, etc.)  
- Concepts from courses or books  

## Goals
- Have quick references for study  
- Write in my own words (to make sure I understand)  
- Share knowledge in a simple way
